# VibeType Agent Context

This file defines how AI assistants (e.g., Gemini CLI) should operate when working inside the **VibeType** repository.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

VibeType is a **local, privacy-focused, voice-driven coding and text manipulation assistant**.
It provides hotkey-based, hands-free interaction with transcription (Whisper), AI processing (Ollama, Cohere), and multi-language TTS (Piper, Kokoro, SAPI, OpenAI).

- Repo language: **Python + Windows-focused UI**
- Scope: Desktop automation, local-first AI, pluggable TTS/AI providers
- Emphasis: **Privacy, modularity, and hands-free UX**

---

## üõ† Coding Conventions

- Follow **PEP8** for Python code.
- Prefer **async/await** over callbacks where supported.
- All functions should include **docstrings**.
- Use **PascalCase** for UI classes, **snake_case** for functions and variables.
- Configuration files = JSON, with **secure storage for API keys**.

    - `hotkeys/` ‚Äî global hotkey system
    - `tts/` ‚Äî TTS provider integrations (Piper, Kokoro w/ Misaki, SAPI, OpenAI)
    - `ai/` ‚Äî AI provider framework (Ollama, Cohere, etc.)
    - `ui/` ‚Äî Settings window, status overlay, tray icon

## ü§ñ Agent Behavior Rules

- Always **propose a plan** (`/plan`) before making code changes.
- Use **small, incremental commits** with clear messages:
    - `feat: add Piper multi-voice support`
    - `fix: correct clipboard privacy toggle`
    - `refactor: move hotkey bindings to config file`
- If a bug fix is requested, first **search logs/tests** before guessing.
- Respect **privacy-first design**: no feature should leak text/audio off-device unless explicitly tied to an external provider.

---

## üîê Security Guidelines

- API keys, model paths, and secrets must be stored **encrypted**.
- Never hardcode sensitive data in code.
- Features like clipboard/microphone access must be **opt-in** and toggleable.

---

## üöÄ Development Workflow

1. Add features behind **toggles or settings** where possible.
2. Ensure **tests exist** for new providers and engines.
3. Update **docs/** whenever a new feature is added.
4. Use **local-first defaults** (Whisper, Piper, Ollama).

## üìä UX & Features Reference

Hotkeys (default):
- Dictation = `<alt>+<caps_lock>`
- AI Dictation = `<scroll_lock>`
- Process Clipboard = `<ctrl>+<alt>+p`
- Speak Clipboard = `<ctrl>+<alt>+c`

UI:
- Tabbed settings window
- Resizable + searchable
- Tray menu for on-the-fly switching
- Status overlay with live feedback

Core Features:
- Profiles & Presets
- Local/External AI & TTS Providers
- Multi-language TTS support (via Kokoro/Misaki)
- Webhooks for automation
- Performance dashboard
- Logging & Monitoring

---

## ‚úÖ To-Do / Active Development

- Resizable settings window with persistent state
- Graceful TTS fallback on crash
- Task runner & file watcher automation
- Auto-updater + portable build

---

## üìå Instructions to AI Agents

- Respect the **project vision**: local-first, privacy-focused, extensible.
- Before modifying code, **analyze context** (read related files).
- Keep PRs/commits **focused on a single change**.
- Always update **feature tracker & docs** when implementing changes.
- **Kokoro TTS Development**: Remember that `kokoro-onnx` is **only for synthesis**. All phonemization **must** be handled by the `misaki` library, which provides separate G2P pipelines for each language. Do not use the tokenizer from `kokoro-onnx`.
- **Japanese TTS Dependency**: The `misaki` library's Japanese phonemizer requires the `mecab-python3` and `unidic-lite` packages. Ensure these are included in `requirements.txt` and installed in the environment.
- add comments to each method, please.
- add comprehensive tests for each feature to prevent regressions. 
- Always keep a log of attempted fixes and know bugs and solutions.
- Maintain readme.md and other documentation files in the project.
