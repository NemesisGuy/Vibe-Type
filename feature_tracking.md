## üöß In Progress & To-Do

### üéõÔ∏è User Experience
- [ ] **Status Overlay:** A small, floating window to show the currently active TTS engine, model, and hotkey usage.
- [ ] **Profiles / Presets:** Allow saving and loading groups of settings (e.g., ‚ÄúWork Mode,‚Äù ‚ÄúReading Mode‚Äù).
- [ ] **On-the-Fly Switching:** A quick tray menu to swap TTS/AI engines without opening the full settings window.
- [ ] **Resizable Settings Window:** Persistent size/position saving.
- [ ] **Searchable Settings:** Add a search bar at the top of the settings window to quickly find a feature.
- [ ] **Voice Preview:** Show waveform visualization or subtitles while TTS is speaking.
- [ ] **Drag & Drop Input:** Drop text or audio files into the app to process with TTS/AI.

### üêû Debugging & Reliability
- [ ] **Logging Window:** A dedicated window to show live logs of TTS/AI events and errors.
- [ ] **Graceful TTS Fallback:** If one TTS engine crashes, automatically switch to a user-selected fallback engine.
- [ ] **Startup Health Check:** A system to check for model/device failures at startup and provide clear warnings.
- [ ] **Error Counters:** Keep counts of engine/model crashes for debugging.

### üß† AI Integration
- [ ] **Output Hooks:** Allow sending AI responses/transcriptions to external apps via local API/webhook.

### üîê Security & Privacy

### üìä Analytics & Telemetry (Local Only)
- [ ] **Live Monitoring:** Display transcription/TTS latency and processing time.

### üîÑ Automation & Integration
- [ ] **Task Runner:** Define workflows like ‚ÄúWhen Whisper transcribes ‚Üí Save text to file + speak with TTS.‚Äù
- [ ] **External API Hook:** Option to send transcription/AI results to a local HTTP endpoint for integration.
- [ ] **File Watcher:** Watch a folder for new `.txt` or `.wav` files and process automatically.
- [ ] **Global Commands API:** Local CLI/IPC like `vibetype --speak "Hello"`.

### üì¶ Deployment & Updates
- [ ] **Portable Build:** A version that runs without installation.
- [ ] **Auto-Updater:** Check GitHub/releases and update in place.
- [ ] **Config Export/Import:** Save and restore all settings to a `.json` file.
	
### üß™ Testing & QA
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Engines:** Mock SAPI, Piper, Kokoro, and ensure init/playback works.
- [ ] **UI Regression Tests:** Automated checks for broken layouts (esp. dark mode).
- [ ] **Stress Test Mode:** Continuous transcription + TTS to test stability and memory leaks.

- **Speech-to-Speech Mode:** Speak into Whisper ‚Üí AI generates reply ‚Üí TTS speaks reply.
- **Minimal Mode / Focus Mode:** Hide most UI elements, leaving only tray + hotkeys.
- **Scriptable Workflows:** Chain actions (e.g., transcribe ‚Üí send to AI ‚Üí read aloud ‚Üí save to file).
- **Cloud Sync:** Sync profiles/presets across devices.
- **Voice Cloning Support:** Experimental option for custom voices in supported engines.
- **Cross-Platform Builds:** Linux/macOS builds with native audio backends.
- **Accessibility Features:** Screen reader integration, large-text mode, and simple keyboard navigation.
- **Community Model Repository:** Curated hub for downloading Piper/Kokoro/Whisper voices and AI prompts.
